yo.

if you’re reading this, congrats. the code didn’t explode.  
on my system, it runs smoother than butter on a hot dosa.  
if it doesn’t on yours... well, that sounds like a YOU problem.

I know my shit. I wrote this code with my bare hands, utterly sleep-deprived and fueled by iced coffee and divine spite.  

don’t touch anything. not a line, not a space,  
not even a cute little comment like “# haha”.  
the code works because I made it work.

✋ hands off. consider this your only warning.

sincerely,
